# lmsh-final-308-proj
Final project for the lawn mower side hustle group in CIS 308

The goal of this project was to develop a maze solving algoritm in c. The main restriction was that the "robot" going through the maze was only able to see adjacent cells. Therefore, we implemented a floodfill based algorithm to find the shortest route from the robots location to the end for each move.
